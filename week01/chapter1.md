# Chapter 1: About React and Next.js

## 🧩 What is React?
React is a **JavaScript library** for building interactive user interfaces (UI). It provides helpful functions (APIs) to create UI components, but leaves decisions about structure and tooling to the developer. This flexibility has led to a rich ecosystem of third-party tools.

### Key Points:
- React focuses on building UI elements users interact with.
- It’s relatively **unopinionated**, meaning developers choose how to structure their apps.
- Building a full React app requires additional tools for routing, data fetching, etc.

## 🧱 What is Next.js?
Next.js is a **React framework** that adds structure, configuration, and optimization tools to React projects. It simplifies common tasks like routing, rendering, and data fetching.

### Key Points:
- Next.js handles tooling and configuration for React.
- It offers features like **server-side rendering**, **static site generation**, and **API routes**.
- Developers can incrementally adopt Next.js features to improve performance and scalability.

## 🧠 Why Use Them Together?
React gives you the building blocks for UI, while Next.js provides the architecture to build full-stack applications. Together, they support:
- Fast performance
- Scalable infrastructure
- Better developer experience

## 🔍 Reflection
This chapter clarified the difference between a **library** (React) and a **framework** (Next.js). It also introduced the core components of modern web applications—UI, routing, data, rendering, integrations, infrastructure, performance, scalability, and developer experience.
