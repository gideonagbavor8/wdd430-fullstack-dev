# Chapter 2: Rendering User Interfaces (UI)

## 🌐 How Browsers Render UI
When a user visits a web page, the server sends an **HTML file** to the browser. The browser reads this file and constructs the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.

### 🧱 What is the DOM?
- The **DOM** is an object-based representation of HTML elements.
- It forms a **tree-like structure** with parent-child relationships.
- Acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface.

## 🛠️ DOM Manipulation
Using **JavaScript** and **DOM methods**, developers can:
- Select specific elements
- Add, update, or delete elements
- Change styles and content dynamically
- Listen to user events (e.g., clicks, input)

This allows for interactive and responsive web pages.

## 🔍 Key Concepts
- DOM manipulation is **imperative**: you tell the browser exactly what to do step-by-step.
- React introduces a **declarative** approach: you describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the updates.

## ✅ Quiz Reflection
> True or False: You can update the page content by manipulating the DOM.  
**Answer: True**

## 🧠 Summary
This chapter helped me understand how browsers interpret HTML and how JavaScript interacts with the DOM to render and update UI. It sets the foundation for understanding how React abstracts and optimizes this process.
